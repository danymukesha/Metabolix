`Metabolix` a dual-language toolkit (R and Python) for accessing, processing, and analyzing metabolomics data from the Alzheimer's Disease Metabolomics Consortium Longitudinal Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Q500 Biocrates (ADMCLongitudinalADNIQ500Biocrates) Study. It provides functions to load and process metabolomics data, perform statistical analysis, and apply advanced machine learning algorithms—including deep learning methods—to identify biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease. The data includes metabolite measurements from *4891* human serum samples across ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO/2, acquired using the Biocrates MxP® Quant 500 kit.
